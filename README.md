Arch Linux dotfiles
========

# Contents #

 * Zsh (uses zsh-syntax-highlighting, zbell, autojump, ls++)
 * Vim (with Vundle as package manager)
 * Tmux (with powerline)
 * Awesome WM dotfiles
 * Git and some helper scripts
 * Misc minor soft (pentadactyl, ranger, mpd, mplayer, mpv, rtorrent etc)
 * See nfo/paks.txt for full packages list with comments and nfo/setup.txt for tweaking


# TODO #

* Move repo out of home, use symlinks and some setup script.
* Test dotfiles on OSX (zsh, tmux, vim), make universal setup.
